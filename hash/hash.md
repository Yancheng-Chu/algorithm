Given an integer array nums and an integer target value target, please find the two integers in the array whose sum is the target value target, and return their array indices.

You can assume that each input will only correspond to one answer. However, the same element in the array cannot appear repeatedly in the answer.

You can return the answers in any order.


Example 1:

Input: nums=[2,7,11,15], target=9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums [0]+nums [1]==9, returns [0,1].
Example 2:

Input: nums=[3,2,4], target=6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums=[3,3], target=6
Output: [0,1]
